### What is this
A wrapper for the iFunny application API, with some extra functionality. This aims to objectify iFunny features in a way idiomatic to Python. This includes interfacing with the regular iFunny client, as well as interfacing with iFunny's chat with decoratable commands and events inspired by the design of [discordpy](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
